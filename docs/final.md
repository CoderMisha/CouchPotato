## Project Summary

Welcome to our Couch Potato project! In this project, we intend to solve an natural language processing problem under the environment built by Malmo API. Imagine you are blind or a pretty lazy person who do not want to think or perceive the game world by yourself, you can now ask our agent of what you want to know based on its current position. Under the control of the user, our agent will explore the game world it perceived and then answer questions asked by the user. So that, understanding what the question is asking and then link this question to the correct function for computing the result will be our main goal of this project.
So far, our agent can answer following type of questions:

1. Closest entity relative to agent architecture or other landscapes
2. Entity location relative to agent architecture or other landscapes
3. Count entities based on position
4. Describe current environment
